      Trend Prediction
    </h1>
    <p>We are researchers interested in understanding potential factors that induce bias in people's prediction of
      trends. Thus, the purpose of this study
      is to identify whether some factors cause over/underestimate. You will be
      asked to perform an attention demanding task on a computer screen. You will be presented with graphs, and will be
      asked to interact with them
      as per the provided instructions. Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you
      would encounter in daily life.
      You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study.</p>
